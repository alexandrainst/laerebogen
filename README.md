# LÃ¦rebogen - A Danish Instruction-Following Dataset Generation Recipe

This is a Danish instruction-following dataset generation recipe, which is based on the
English Alpaca/SelfInstruct and EvolInstruct dataset generation recipes.

The dataset is generated using commercially viable large language models (LLMs) via the
Ollama inference framework, enabling a permissive dataset license, in contrast to the
English Alpaca dataset.
