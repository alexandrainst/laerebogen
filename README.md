# Alpaka - A Danish Instruction-Following Dataset Generation Recipe

This is a Danish version of the English Alpaca dataset generation recipe, which can be
used to generate Danish instruction-following datasets using generative base models
hosted on Ollama. We also release a Danish instruction-following dataset, Alpaka,
containing X instructions and responses.
